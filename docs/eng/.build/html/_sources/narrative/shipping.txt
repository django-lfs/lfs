Shipping
========

General
-------
* There can be several shipping methods, e.g. "standard" and "express" from
  which the customer can choose.

* A shipping method can be set to active/inactive by a simple flag.

* The shipping methods may be restricted by criteria, e.g. the shop owner just
  want to provide "express" when the customer lives within a certain country. 
  
* Only when **all** criteria of a shipping method are true the shipping method 
  is valid.

* Only active and valid shipping methods are provided to choose.

* A shipping method has a default price, which is by default the current price
  of the shipping method.

* A shipping method can have additional prices for a shipping method. Example: 
  if the total cart price is greater than x the price for "standard" shipping 
  method should be y.
  
* Shipping method prices are restricted by criteria. The first price for which
  all criteria a true is the current price of the shipping method. If no 
  additional price is true the default price of the shippping method is taken as
  the current price.

* First the customer gets the default shipping method automatically. This is -
  at the moment and might be changed - the first active and valid shipping 
  method.

* If the current choosen shipping method gets invalid after the shop customer
  changes her cart the default shipping method will be assigned.
